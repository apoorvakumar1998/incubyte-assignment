# String Calculator
# This project is part of an assignment for Incubyte. It involves building a String Calculator using React and JavaScript with a focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD).

# Features
  Add numbers from a string input.
  Handle custom delimiters.
  Support for empty strings, newlines, and multiple numbers.
  Test-driven development approach with thorough unit testing.

# Available Scripts
  In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

  # npm start
    Runs the app in development mode.
    Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser.
    The page will reload automatically if you make changes to the code.

  # npm test
    Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
    It will run all the test cases to ensure the correctness of the application based on the TDD approach.

# Project Structure
  src/: Contains the source code for the String Calculator application.
  components/: React components for the calculator UI.
  utils/: Helper functions related to the calculator logic.
  tests/: Unit tests for the calculator functions and components.

  
# Testing Methodology
  This project follows the TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology. The steps are:

  Write failing tests for the new feature.
  Implement the feature to pass the test.
  Refactor the code to improve quality, while ensuring all tests still pass.

# Technologies Used
  React: For building the UI.
  Jest: For writing and running unit tests.
  JavaScript: For the calculator logic.


# How to Use the Application
  Enter a string of numbers in the input box.
  Click the "Calculate" button to get the sum.
  View the result on the screen.
